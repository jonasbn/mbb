TODO file for Module::Build::Bundle

- The initial version holds two methods from Module::Build::Base, which have
  been lifted and changed. The plan is to have these two patched in
  Module::Build::Base, but for know we keep the changed versions, until the
  patches have been created, sent, evaluated and hopefully accepted.

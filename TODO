TODO file for Module::Build::Bundle

- The initial version held two methods from Module::Build::Base, which have
  been lifted and changed. The plan is to have these two patched in
  Module::Build::Base, but for know we keep the changed versions, until the
  patches have been created, sent, evaluated and hopefully accepted.

  This have changed however so we hold more stuff from Module::Build since
  Module::Build has changed a lot, we now rely on 0.42 and the job might be bigger

- Replace regular expression based search and replace by Pod::Weaver
  implementation.

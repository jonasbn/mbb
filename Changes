0.14 2015-08-09 Significant maintenance release, update recommended

- Addressed broken test suite [RT:94847]
  
  introducing the following method lifted from Module::Build::Base:

  - do_create_metafile

  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94847

- Core implementation updated to comply with Module::Build 0.42

- Changed license to be Artistic 2.0, please see the LICENSE file included
  with the distribution

- Examined and addressed issues with Module::Build compability, we are now
  dependent on version 0.42. New code lifted from Module::Build since
  proper inheritance is not possible at this time, pondering patches

- The whole test suite has been revisited and all tests now pass again
  as we rely on File::Tempdir instead of own logic, this eliminated a lot
  of code and removed at least one bug

- Addressed [Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy] _pragma_utf8
  requires 5.008, so perl requirement has been bumped up to version
  5.006.

- Added changes.t automatic assertion of the integrity of the Changes file
